# Farm-App
A simple farm app that displays product and price.
Over the course of this simple node-farm project, i learnt how to use "fs" read file, how to write file and how to manipulate files.
I learnt how to create my own module locally and use it in my project and i also learn how to work with the basics of nodejs like creating server with "http" module, routing with "url" and even working with third party module like "slugify". I made my own module, used them and export them as well..
